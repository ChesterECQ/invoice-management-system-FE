<!-- Assumption -->
## Assumption
<p>
    As there is no exact details regarding what the front end application would look like, the following assumptions were made:
        <li>This is a single page application.</li>
        <li>There is no specific search criteria therfore a search would include all column in tha table.</li>
        <li>As the sample data file is in CSV format, file type that can be uploaded would only be of CSV format.</li>
</p>
